# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on cleaning up and enhancing the existing Kubernetes monitoring, RAG, and dashboard system. The project currently has duplicate files, inconsistent structure, and needs optimization for better maintainability and performance. The goal is to create a well-structured, production-ready system with clear separation of concerns and improved developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on this project, I want a clean and well-organized codebase, so that I can easily navigate, understand, and contribute to the system without confusion from duplicate or unnecessary files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN the system SHALL have no duplicate README files
2. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL have consistent file naming conventions across all modules
3. WHEN exploring directories THEN the system SHALL have clear separation between frontend and backend components
4. IF there are unused or obsolete files THEN the system SHALL remove them from the repository
5. WHEN checking dependencies THEN the system SHALL have no conflicting or duplicate package requirements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the project structure to follow industry best practices, so that deployment, maintenance, and scaling are straightforward and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL have a clear Docker containerization strategy
2. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN the system SHALL provide consistent setup scripts for different platforms
3. WHEN managing configurations THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for all sensitive data
4. IF there are multiple ways to run the same component THEN the system SHALL consolidate to a single, clear approach
5. WHEN examining the project THEN the system SHALL have proper .gitignore rules to exclude build artifacts and sensitive files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want the React application to be properly structured and optimized, so that I can build modern, performant user interfaces efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with the frontend THEN the system SHALL use a consistent component architecture pattern
2. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL have optimized build processes and bundle sizes
3. WHEN developing UI components THEN the system SHALL follow accessibility best practices
4. IF there are conflicting UI frameworks THEN the system SHALL use a single, consistent design system
5. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use appropriate state management patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want the Python services to be well-structured and follow best practices, so that the system is maintainable, testable, and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the backend code THEN the system SHALL follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
2. WHEN running services THEN the system SHALL have proper error handling and logging
3. WHEN testing functionality THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive test coverage for critical components
4. IF there are multiple API implementations THEN the system SHALL consolidate to a single, well-designed API
5. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use virtual environments and pinned versions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clear documentation and setup procedures, so that I can deploy and maintain the system without ambiguity or missing information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the system THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step installation guides
2. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL have comprehensive logging and error messages
3. WHEN configuring the system THEN the system SHALL document all required environment variables
4. IF there are multiple deployment options THEN the system SHALL clearly document the recommended approach
5. WHEN maintaining the system THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring and health check endpoints

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious operator, I want the system to follow security best practices, so that sensitive data is protected and the system is resilient against common vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling API keys THEN the system SHALL never expose them in code or logs
2. WHEN communicating between services THEN the system SHALL use secure protocols and authentication
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate access controls
4. IF there are security vulnerabilities in dependencies THEN the system SHALL update to secure versions
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL follow container security best practices
