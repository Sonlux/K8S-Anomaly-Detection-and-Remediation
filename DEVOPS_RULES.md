# DevOps Rules for Kubernetes Multi-Agent System

This document outlines the key DevOps principles and practices to be adhered to within this project. These rules are designed to ensure consistency, reliability, security, and efficient collaboration.

## 1. Version Control Best Practices

*   **Branching Strategy:** Utilize a clear branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow or GitHub Flow). Feature branches for new development, `develop` for integration, and `main` (or `master`) for production-ready code.
*   **Commit Messages:** Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages. Use a conventional commit format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`) to categorize changes.
*   **Code Reviews:** All code changes must undergo a peer review process before merging into `develop` or `main` branches. At least one approval is required.
*   **Sensitive Information:** Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, private certificates) directly into the repository. Use Kubernetes Secrets, environment variables, or a secrets management solution.

## 2. Continuous Integration (CI)

*   **Automated Builds:** Implement automated build processes for all components (e.g., Docker images for agents).
*   **Automated Testing:** Integrate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests into the CI pipeline. All tests must pass before a merge is allowed.
*   **Linting and Static Analysis:** Enforce code quality standards using linters (e.g., Pylint, Black for Python) and static analysis tools. Integrate these checks into the CI pipeline.
*   **Dependency Management:** Use `requirements.txt` (or similar) to explicitly manage Python dependencies. Ensure dependencies are regularly updated and scanned for vulnerabilities.

## 3. Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)

*   **Automated Deployments:** Automate the deployment of Kubernetes manifests and Docker images to development, staging, and production environments.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Treat infrastructure (Kubernetes clusters, nodes) as immutable. Changes should be made by deploying new versions rather than modifying existing ones in place.
*   **Rollback Strategy:** Ensure every deployment has a clear and tested rollback strategy to revert to a previous stable state quickly.
*   **Progressive Delivery:** Consider implementing progressive delivery techniques (e.g., canary deployments, blue/green deployments) for critical updates.

## 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

*   **Kubernetes Manifests:** All Kubernetes deployments, services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, etc., must be defined as code (YAML manifests) and version-controlled.
*   **Configuration Management:** Manage application configurations (e.g., `agent_config.yaml`, `model_config.yaml`) as code. Use templating tools (e.g., Helm, Kustomize) where appropriate.

## 5. Monitoring and Alerting

*   **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Monitor all layers of the stack: Kubernetes cluster health, pod metrics, application performance, and agent-specific metrics (e.g., anomaly detection rates, remediation success/failure).
*   **Alerting:** Define clear alerting rules with appropriate thresholds and notification channels for critical issues. Alerts should be actionable and minimize noise.
*   **Dashboarding:** Create dashboards (e.g., Grafana with Prometheus) to visualize key metrics and system health at a glance.
*   **Log Aggregation:** Centralize logs from all pods and agents into a single logging solution for easy searching, analysis, and troubleshooting.

## 6. Security

*   **Least Privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege to all service accounts, roles, and network policies within Kubernetes.
*   **Image Security:** Regularly scan Docker images for vulnerabilities. Use trusted base images.
*   **Network Policies:** Implement Kubernetes Network Policies to control traffic flow between pods and namespaces.
*   **Secrets Management:** Use Kubernetes Secrets or a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) for sensitive data. Avoid hardcoding secrets.

## 7. Testing

*   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for individual functions and classes within the agents and core logic.
*   **Integration Tests:** Develop integration tests to verify the interaction between different agents and with Kubernetes APIs.
*   **End-to-End Tests:** Implement end-to-end tests to simulate real-world scenarios, from anomaly detection to successful remediation.
*   **Chaos Engineering (Optional but Recommended):** Introduce controlled failures (e.g., terminate pods, inject network latency) to test the system's resilience and remediation capabilities.

## 8. Documentation

*   **READMEs:** Maintain up-to-date `README.md` files for the overall project and significant sub-directories, explaining setup, usage, and architecture.
*   **Code Comments:** Write clear and concise comments for complex logic, functions, and classes.
*   **Runbooks:** Create runbooks for common operational procedures, troubleshooting steps, and incident response.

## 9. Environment Management

*   **Environment Parity:** Strive for maximum parity between development, staging, and production environments to minimize "it works on my machine" issues.
*   **Dedicated Environments:** Maintain separate, isolated environments for development, testing, and production.

By adhering to these rules, your team can build, deploy, and operate this sophisticated Kubernetes multi-agent system with greater confidence and efficiency.
