# RAG System Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Duplicate Method Definitions**: The `agentic_rag_cli.py` file had multiple duplicate method definitions:

   - Multiple `query` methods (lines 293, 367, 445)
   - Multiple `add_message` methods (lines 264, 343, 421)
   - Multiple `get_chat_history_as_text` methods (lines 274, 353, 431)

2. **LLM Not Receiving Structured Pod Data**: The system was fetching formatted string data from `fetch_k8s_info()` but not providing structured JSON data to the LLM for analysis.

3. **LLM Initialization Issue**: The `NvidiaLLM` class was being initialized without the required API key parameter.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Consolidated Method Definitions

- Removed all duplicate method definitions
- Kept only one version of each method with the correct functionality
- Ensured the `query` method returns a string (not a dict) for CLI compatibility

### 2. Enhanced Pod Data Processing

- Added structured pod data extraction in the `query` method
- When a pod-related query is detected, the system now:
  - Fetches formatted string data for display (via `fetch_k8s_info`)
  - Extracts structured JSON data for LLM analysis (via `k8s_client_utils`)
  - Passes the structured data to the LLM in the prompt

### 3. Fixed LLM Initialization

- Updated `initialize_llm()` method to properly handle API key requirements
- Added support for loading API key from environment variables or `.env` file
- Added proper error handling for missing API keys

### 4. Improved Prompt Engineering

- Enhanced the system prompt to include structured pod data analysis instructions
- Added specific guidance for analyzing pod statuses, restart counts, and issues
- Maintained the existing knowledge base context integration

## Key Changes in `agentic_rag_cli.py`

### Before (Issues):

```python
# Multiple duplicate methods
def query(self, user_input: str) -> dict:  # Line 293
def query(self, user_input: str) -> dict:  # Line 367
def query(self, user_input: str) -> dict:  # Line 445

# LLM initialization without API key
self.llm = NvidiaLLM()  # Missing API key

# No structured pod data for LLM
k8s_info = fetch_k8s_info(user_input)  # Only formatted string
```

### After (Fixed):

```python
# Single consolidated method
def query(self, user_input: str) -> str:

# Proper LLM initialization with API key
nvidia_api_key = os.environ.get("NVIDIA_API_KEY")
self.llm = NvidiaLLM(api_key=nvidia_api_key)

# Structured pod data extraction for LLM
if "pod" in user_input.lower() and k8s_fetcher_available:
    # Get structured pod data from k8s_client_utils
    pod_data = get_pod_info(namespace)
    # Add to LLM prompt
    prompt += f"Pod Data:\n{json.dumps(pod_data, indent=2)}\n\n"
```

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Set up environment**:

   ```bash
   cd k8s/kubescape/backend
   export NVIDIA_API_KEY="your-nvidia-api-key"
   ```

2. **Run the test script**:

   ```bash
   python test_rag_fix.py
   ```

3. **Run the main CLI**:

   ```bash
   python agentic_rag_cli.py
   ```

4. **Test with pod queries**:
   ```
   get pods
   show me all pods in all namespaces
   what's the status of my pods?
   ```

## Expected Behavior

After the fixes, when you ask "get pods", the system should:

1. **Fetch real-time pod data** from your Kubernetes cluster
2. **Display formatted pod information** in the "Real-Time Kubernetes Data" section
3. **Analyze the pod data** using the LLM in the "LLM Reasoning & Guidance" section
4. **Provide insights** about:
   - Pod status issues (Pending, CrashLoopBackOff, etc.)
   - High restart counts and potential causes
   - Resource usage patterns
   - Actionable recommendations

## Example Expected Output

```
--- Real-Time Kubernetes Data ---
üì¶ **Pods in all namespaces:**

Namespace: default
  ‚úÖ ai-failure-predictor-65c79ffdf9-j8x8v
     Status: Running, Node: minikube, IP: 10.244.8.111
     Containers:
       ‚úÖ ai-failure-predictor (Restarts: 44)
  ‚ö†Ô∏è stress-test-6cdb9cb4b9-9cxjm
     Status: Pending, Node: minikube, IP: 10.244.8.132
     Containers:
       ‚ùå stress (Restarts: 0)

--- LLM Reasoning & Guidance ---
Based on the pod data analysis, I can see several important patterns:

**Issues Identified:**
1. **High Restart Counts**: Multiple pods show high restart counts (44-819 restarts), indicating application instability
2. **Pending Pods**: The stress-test pod is stuck in Pending state, likely due to resource constraints
3. **Container Readiness**: Some containers are not ready, suggesting startup issues

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The high restart counts suggest application crashes or resource exhaustion
- Pending pods indicate insufficient cluster resources (CPU/memory)
- Minikube's single-node architecture may be resource-constrained

**Recommendations:**
1. Check pod logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name>` for crash reasons
2. Monitor resource usage: `kubectl top pods`
3. Consider scaling down workloads or increasing Minikube resources
4. Review application health checks and resource limits

**Priority: High** - Multiple pods showing instability requires immediate attention.
```

## Files Modified

1. `k8s/kubescape/backend/agentic_rag_cli.py` - Main fixes
2. `k8s/kubescape/backend/test_rag_fix.py` - Test script (new)

## Next Steps

1. Test the system with your NVIDIA API key
2. Verify that pod data is properly analyzed by the LLM
3. Check that the knowledge base integration still works
4. Consider adding more specific analysis patterns for different types of Kubernetes issues
